This folder contains all the datasets required and generated for the analyses presented in the paper. The contents are organized as follows:

1. **pipelineOutputs**: Contains the database of pG4s generated using the mapsea tool followed by the graph-based pipeline, as described in the paper.
2. **functionalOutputs**: Includes the datasets generated by scripts for annotating pG4s into functional categories.
3. **dataForAnalysis**: This directory contains datasets and subfolders required for data analysis. The subdirectories are:
    - **corrG4EnrichvsGC**: Contains data for generating windows to analyze the correlation between G4 enrichment and GC content.
    - **geneAnnotations**: Holds gene annotations for all great apes, downloaded from NCBI. For enhancers, of non-human great apes, they were lifted-over from human annotations. Only humans, had the annotaitons for the origins of replication. 
    - **genomeLength**: Contains information on total genome length and the lengths of individual chromosomes for all great ape species.
    - **genomes**: Includes the genomes of all great apes as compressed FASTA files.
    - **maps**: Contains the HSA map mapping chromosome numbers across great apes.
    - **methylationData**: Contains 5mC methylation data, as obtained from *Yoo et al., 2024*.
    - **newT2Tregions**: Stores the newly resolved T2T (telomere-to-telomere) regions for each species, along with the pG4s found within them.
    - **phylogeny**: Contains the nexus file required for generating the phylogeny using PAUP.
    - **repeatAnnotations**: Includes repeat annotations for all great apes, derived using RepeatMasker.
